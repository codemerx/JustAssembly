# JustAssembly

JustAssembly is a lightweight .NET assembly diff and analysis tool built on top of the [Telerik JustDecompile Engine](https://github.com/codemerx/JustDecompileEngine). As opposed to just comparing signatures, it produces a diff on all assembly contents including the code of the methods.

## Command line usage

It is possible to use JustAssembly with command line interface, in order to generate an XML file with assembly public API differences.

That effectively makes it possible to use JustAssembly in an automated build pipeline to analyse differences between the output of the previous and the latest build (Semantic Versioning in future release, see issue #14 for details).

*Commandlinetool.exe* accepts three arguments
1) First assembly path
2) Second assembly path
3) XML output path 

```
justassembly.commandlinetool.exe Path\To\Assembly1 Path\To\Assembly2 Path\To\XMLOutput.xml
```

## How to Get Started

JustAssembly uses [JustDecompileEngine](https://github.com/codemerx/JustDecompileEngine) as a submodule. In order to get the submodule's code together with the main repo you need to pass `--recursive` to the `git clone` command. If you already cloned the repo in the traditional way, don't worry. First you need to initialize your local configuration file using `git submodule init`. Then use `git submodule update` to fetch all the data from [JustDecompileEngine](https://github.com/codemerx/JustDecompileEngine) and check out the appropriate commit.
